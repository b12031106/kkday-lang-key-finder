# Feature Specification: Chrome Extension for I18n Key Lookup

**Feature Branch**: `001-chrome-extension-i18n`
**Created**: 2025-09-22
**Status**: Draft
**Input**: User description: "Chrome extension tool for finding i18n translation keys from page text"

## User Scenarios & Testing

### Primary User Story
As a developer working on KKday websites, I want to quickly find the translation key for any text I see on the page, so that I can efficiently locate and modify translation strings without manually searching through i18n files.

### Acceptance Scenarios
1. **Given** I'm on a KKday website with i18n data, **When** I type text into the search box, **Then** I see a ranked list of matching translation keys with their values
2. **Given** I'm on a KKday website, **When** I click the element selection tool and click on page text, **Then** the text is automatically searched and matching keys are displayed
3. **Given** I find a matching translation key, **When** I click on it, **Then** the key is copied to my clipboard and I see a success notification
4. **Given** I'm on a non-KKday website, **When** I open the extension, **Then** I see a message that this is not a target website and search features are disabled
5. **Given** I'm on a KKday website without accessible i18n data, **When** I try to search, **Then** I see an error message that translation data cannot be found

### Edge Cases
- What happens when multiple translation keys have identical values?
- How does the system handle empty or very short search queries?
- What occurs when the clicked element contains nested text or mixed content?
- How does the extension behave when i18n data structure changes?

## Requirements

### Functional Requirements
- **FR-001**: Extension MUST only activate on *.kkday.com domains
- **FR-002**: System MUST provide a text input field for manual translation text search
- **FR-003**: System MUST provide an element selection tool for clicking page text
- **FR-004**: System MUST extract translation data from page's global variables based on URL patterns
- **FR-005**: System MUST perform fuzzy search on translation values and rank results by accuracy
- **FR-006**: Users MUST be able to copy translation keys to clipboard by clicking search results
- **FR-007**: System MUST show visual feedback when clipboard copy succeeds
- **FR-008**: System MUST display appropriate error messages when domain is invalid or data is unavailable
- **FR-009**: System MUST differentiate between product page URLs (/{lang}/product/[numbers]) and other pages for data source selection
- **FR-010**: Search results MUST display both the translation key and its corresponding value

### Key Entities
- **Translation Entry**: Contains a key (string identifier) and value (translated text)
- **Search Result**: Translation entry with relevance score from fuzzy matching
- **Page Context**: Current URL and domain information used to determine data extraction method
- **User Interaction**: Either text input or element selection action that triggers search
